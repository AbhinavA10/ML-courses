# Kaggle Competition Lessons

Some lessons / tutorial notebooks from Kaggle Courses that are also submissions to Kaggle Competitions, or more real-world examples

# Higgs Boson Notebook
The notebook covers:
- using Kaggle's TPU
- parsing `TFRecords` and building a `tf.data.Dataset` object to be used for training
- example of using Keras' Functional API for model building
- using a **Learning rate schedule** to increase or decrease learning rate as needed. (gradually decreasing the learning rate over the course of training can improve performance)


# Petals to the Metal Notebook
Use Kaggle's TPUs to make a submission to the Petals to the Metal competition
